Real-Time Fraud Detection System for Banking Transactions using modern data engineering tools


Real-Time Fraud Detection System for Banking Transactions
This project implements a Real-Time Fraud Detection System to combat financial fraud in banking transactions. The system addresses the challenge of identifying fraudulent activities in real time, minimizing financial losses and enhancing the security of digital banking systems.

Problem It Solves
Fraudulent transactions are a significant concern for financial institutions, leading to monetary loss, reputational damage, and customer distrust. Traditional fraud detection methods, which rely on batch processing, are often slow and unable to respond instantly. This system solves this issue by providing:

Real-time monitoring and analysis of transactions.
Instant alerts for suspicious activities.
Scalability to handle large volumes of data.
Key Features
Real-Time Data Streaming: Built using Apache Kafka for ingesting and processing streaming data.
Data Pipelines: Robust ETL pipelines designed for seamless data flow and transformation.
Fraud Detection Engine: Machine learning models or rule-based algorithms for anomaly detection.
Scalable Architecture: High-throughput and low-latency processing using Apache Spark and Snowflake.
Visualization: Interactive dashboards for monitoring transactions and fraud alerts.
Tech Stack
Languages: Python, SQL
Tools & Platforms: Apache Kafka, Spark, Snowflake, PostgreSQL
Visualization: Tableau/Power BI
